# PythonProgramming
Various programs that were created during learning python. 

Any comments and hints are most welcomed. 

Program random_num.py is a simple game, where computer stores a random number between 1 and 100 and the user is asked to find this in less than 10 guesses. The project/idea was taken from an online course on Python from the University of Crete (https://mathesis.cup.gr/courses/course-v1:ComputerScience+CS1.1+21D/about). It was one of the early assignments. I was not able to verify the solution with the teachers because the course was not actively running at that time, it was available only for self learning.
